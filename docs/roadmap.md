New ideas for the project
- Add a way to use the project via the command line (similar to Rust project damn)
- Add new usages by having argparse to parse new arguments
- Organize the folders either by where the script is invoked or by where the user says so via a path
- Add safe guards to make sure that user does not kill his computer :D
